    "We can apply a process as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) For $k = 1, 2, ...$ We sample x' from a distribution $Q(x^k \\rightarrow x')$\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Accept proposal x' with probability $A(x^k \\rightarrow x')$\n",
    "\n",
    "So,  $Q(x \\rightarrow x')$ defines the probability to go from x to x' and $A(x \\rightarrow x')$ is the so called critic which gives the probabilty of accepting the proposal. And, we can defime the transition probabilty $T(x \\rightarrow x')$ which is the product of the proposed dist. and our critic. \n",
    "\n",
    "We want our MC to generate point from the desired distribution which a stationary state (We assume the posteriori we want to sample is a stationary state of an MC):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi(x') = \\sum_x \\pi(x) T(x \\rightarrow x')$\n",
    "\n",
    "As the transition matrix here is a product of $Q$ and $A$ we try to find $A$ such that the above equation being sattisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting to find A, there is a short cut for definition of stationary state which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "if $\\pi(x) T(x \\rightarrow x') = \\pi(x') T(x' \\rightarrow x)$ then $\\pi(x)$ is stationary. \n",
    "The proof is really easy! and is presented below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We use summation operator for both sides of the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_x \\pi(x) T(x \\rightarrow x') = \\sum_x \\pi(x') T(x' \\rightarrow x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "2) x' is coming out of summation because is independet of x:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_x \\pi(x) T(x \\rightarrow x') = \\pi(x') \\sum_x T(x' \\rightarrow x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "3) As sum over all the possible outcomes of gping form x' to x is one, the above equation becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sum_x \\pi(x) T(x \\rightarrow x') = \\pi(x')$\n",
    "\n",
    "***Now lets get back to our problem, we are looking for a critic such that the MC created by it will produce samples from a stattionary dist. $\\pi(x)$***\n",
    "***So we check for a critic A such that it makes a transition matrix T that satisfies stationary state equation of the form:***\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\pi(x) T(x \\rightarrow x') = \\pi(x') T(x' \\rightarrow x)$\n",
